Attempted to create a script to perform a brachistochrone optimisation numerically, used to find the most efficienct path between two points such as for ideal racing lines. Doesn't quite work unfortunately!

Idea came from the video: [Dynamic programming for solving Brachistochrone optimization problem in Python](https://youtu.be/u-Rfgu2EgBU?si=xsjOxFa7x6mI3m5C)
